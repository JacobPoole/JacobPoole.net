	<h3>Hello! </h3>

	<h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My name is Jacob Poole, I'm a second year computer science major at the University of California Riverside. <br>
	My emphasis is in embedded systems and I love to create and play with robots. I'm very involved on campus <br>
	with the organizations listed below. <br><br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Outreach Chair [<b>2016-2017</b>], Freshmen Representative [<b>2015-2016</b>] for the Society of Women Engineers<br>      
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Vice-Chair [<b>2017-2018</b>], Program Chair [<b>2016-2017</b>] for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers <br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Director [<b>2016-2017</b>], Planning Lead [<b>2015-2016</b>] for Citrus Hack <br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Outreach Chair [<b>2016-2017</b>] for the Association of Computing Machinery <br>
	<br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With all of these, I also volunteer and mentor my high school robotics team, FIRST FRC Team 589 Falkon Robotics. <br>
	 With them competing in the winter for six weeks to design and build a function robot for a given game. I mentor <br>
	them in programming, electronics and driving the robot. <br> <br>

 	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I've always loved working with kids. That's the reason I ran for outreach chair and program chair in my organizations. In high school, I became a teacher's assistant for a robotics class and fell in love with workign with the kids. Just teaching them about engineering and having the learn from me felt so special. I specifically remember multiple times while working withkids on computer science assignments, I would slowly walk them through their error/problem until they suddenly said the word "OHHH" and finally realize how it works. That's when I know I've succeeded. Whenever I help someone or teach someone, that's the moment that I aim for, the "OH" moment. I'd love to teach in the future to inspire the next generation of engineers, but before I do that I'm very excited to join the workforce and enter the industry in embedded systems.
